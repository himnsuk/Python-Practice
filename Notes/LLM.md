3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate your model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Use validation sets to ensure your model generalizes well.

#### Hands-On Practice:
- **Hugging Face Fine-Tuning Example**:
  ```python
  from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
  from datasets import load_dataset

  dataset = load_dataset('imdb')  # Load IMDb sentiment dataset
  tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
  
  model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)
  
  # Tokenize the dataset
  def tokenize_function(examples):
      return tokenizer(examples['text'], padding='max_length', truncation=True)

  tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

  # Define training arguments
  training_args = TrainingArguments(
      output_dir='./results',
      num_train_epochs=3,
      per_device_train_batch_size=8,
      per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
      warmup_steps=500,
      weight_decay=0.01,
      logging_dir='./logs',
  )

  trainer = Trainer(
      model=model,
      args=training_args,
      train_dataset=tokenized_datasets['train'],
      eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets['test'],
  )

### What is Regularization?

**Regularization** is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function of a model. This penalty discourages the model from fitting the noise in the training data and forces it to learn a simpler model with smaller weights, improving generalization to unseen data.

### Why is Regularization Important?

- **Overfitting** occurs when a model learns to memorize the training data, including its noise, instead of capturing the underlying patterns.
- Regularization reduces the complexity of the model by penalizing large coefficients or weights.

### Types of Regularization

1. **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**
2. **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**
3. **Elastic Net Regularization**
4. **Dropout (specific to neural networks)**

### 1. L1 Regularization (Lasso)

In **L1 Regularization**, we add the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients to the loss function.

#### Mathematical Formulation:
For a regression model with weights $( w )$, the regularized loss function is:

$$
L(w) = \text{Loss}(w) + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^n |w_i|
$$

Here:
- $( \text{Loss}(w) )$ is the original loss (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression, Cross-Entropy for classification).
- $( \lambda )$ is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of regularization.
- $( \sum_{i=1}^n |w_i| )$ is the L1 penalty term.

#### Effect:
- Encourages sparsity in weights, i.e., sets some weights to zero, making it useful for feature selection.

### 2. L2 Regularization (Ridge)

In **L2 Regularization**, we add the sum of the squares of the coefficients to the loss function.

#### Mathematical Formulation:
$$
L(w) = \text{Loss}(w) + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2
$$

#### Effect:
- Penalizes large weights but does not enforce sparsity. Instead, it encourages small weights.
- Helps in reducing multicollinearity in regression problems.

### 3. Elastic Net Regularization

Elastic Net is a combination of L1 and L2 regularization.

#### Mathematical Formulation:
$$
L(w) = \text{Loss}(w) + \lambda_1 \sum_{i=1}^n |w_i| + \lambda_2 \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2
$$

#### Effect:
- Balances the benefits of both L1 (sparsity) and L2 (shrinkage of coefficients).

### 4. Dropout (Specific to Neural Networks)

Dropout randomly drops a fraction of the neurons during each training iteration, forcing the network to not rely on specific neurons.

### Regularization in Regression

#### Linear Regression with L2 Regularization:
$$
L(w) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2
$$

- $( y_i )$: Actual output
- $( \hat{y}_i = w^T x_i + b )$: Predicted output

#### Linear Regression with L1 Regularization:
$$
L(w) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^n |w_i|
$$

---

### Regularization in Classification

#### Logistic Regression with L2 Regularization:
$$
L(w) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left[ y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1-y_i) \log(1-\hat{y}_i) \right] + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2
$$

- $( y_i )$: Actual label (0 or 1)
- $( \hat{y}_i = \sigma(w^T x_i + b) )$: Predicted probability, where $( \sigma )$ is the sigmoid function.

#### Logistic Regression with L1 Regularization:
$$
L(w) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left[ y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1-y_i) \log(1-\hat{y}_i) \right] + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^n |w_i|
$$

### Choosing Regularization

1. **L1 Regularization**: When you suspect many features are irrelevant (sparse solutions).
2. **L2 Regularization**: When you believe all features are relevant but want to reduce their impact.
3. **Elastic Net**: When you want a balance between L1 and L2.

---

### Key Notes:

1. **Regularization Parameter ($( \lambda )$)**:
   - A higher $( \lambda )$ means stronger regularization.
   - Needs to be tuned (e.g., using cross-validation).

2. **Impact on Training**:
   - Regularization is applied only during training.
   - It helps balance bias and variance.

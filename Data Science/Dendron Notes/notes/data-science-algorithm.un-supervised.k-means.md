### Elbow Method

In the Elbow method, we are actually varying the number of clusters ( K ) from 1 â€“ 10. For each value of K, we are calculating **WCSS ( Within-Cluster Sum of Square )**. **WCSS is the sum of squared distance between each point and the centroid in a cluster**. When we plot the WCSS with the K value, the plot looks like an Elbow. As the number of clusters increases, the WCSS value will start to decrease. WCSS value is largest when K = 1. When we analyze the graph we can see that the graph will rapidly change at a point and thus creating an elbow shape. From this point, the graph starts to move almost parallel to the X-axis. The K value corresponding to this point is the optimal K value or an optimal number of clusters.

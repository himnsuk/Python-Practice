### Rules for defining variables:


1. Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.  They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number.  For instance, you can call a variable message_1 but not 1_message.
2. Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names. For example, greeting_message works
but greeting message will cause errors.
3. Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names.  For example, do not use the word print as a variable name; Python has reserved it for a particular programmatic purpose. (See “Python Keywords and Built-in Functions” on page 466.)
4. Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is better than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better than length_of_persons_name.
5. Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0

>  The Python variables you’re using at this point should be lowercase. You won’t get
errors if you use uppercase letters, but uppercase letters in variable names have spe-
cial meanings that we’ll discuss in later chapters.

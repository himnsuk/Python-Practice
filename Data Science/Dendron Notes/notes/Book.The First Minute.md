Step 1: Frame the conversation in fifteen seconds or less. Framing provides
context, makes your intentions clear, and gives a clear headline.

Step 2: Create a structured summary of the entire message you need to
deliver. State the goal and define the problem that stands between you and
achieving that goal. Then focus the conversation on the solution.

I am going to start by addressing the most common causes of miscommunication
at work.

1. Lack of context
1. Unclear purpose
1. Not getting to the point
1. Mixing up multiple topics in the same conversation
1. Lengthy, unclear summaries

> You will also learn about the three components of framing—context, intent, and
key message—and how these provide the foundation for a successful
conversation.

> Finally, you’ll discover the three components required of a structured summary:

1. the goal you are trying to achieve,
2. the problem stopping you from reaching that goal, and
3. the solution to the problem. These three things will enable you
to summarize any topic, no matter how complex.

It is possible to make a great first impression with a colleague, only to ruin that
impression when the conversation shifts to work. It doesn’t matter how much
people like you; if you cannot deliver information in an organized way, you will
have a hard time being respected professionally.

### Framing

---

#### Many work conversations started with the following issues

1. Failing to provide context for the message. This happens when the audience doesn’t know what the
topic is about.

2. Not having a clear purpose for the message. This happens when the audience doesn’t know why they are receiving the information.

3. Not getting to the point fast enough. The speaker shares a lot of information and takes too long to get to the critical part of his or her message.

4. Mixing up two or more topics in the same conversation. The speaker has two or
more topics to discuss, but it isn’t clear what they are.

#### Each of these mistakes can be avoided by starting the conversation with three short statements. These statements are required for every work conversation to start with clarity

1. __Context__: This is the topic you want to talk about. Of all the topics in the world, this is the one you will talk about now.

2. __Intent__: What you want the audience to do with the information you are about to share.

3. __Key message__: The most important part of the overall message you are about to deliver (the headline)

#### These elements remain the same no matter what the topic is, who is talking, and who is listening. When used together in the right order, these three elements frame your message

> These may seem abrupt, but the point isn’t to convey your entire message in
fifteen seconds. The point is to let your audience know what you are going to
talk about, so they aren’t guessing for the first few minutes of the conversation. If the first lines of your message provide context, intent, and a key message, you will have clearer conversations every time.

A simple framework may be like as below

This is easy to do if you start your message with a simple context-based statement.

1. Name the project or the issue.
2. Name the process, system, or tool you will talk about.
3. Give the name of the customer with whom you are working.
4. Name the task or objective you want to talk about.

> Never assume the other person knows what you are talking about.

#### Here are some examples of contexts that you may need to provide in everyday work situations

1. I’m working on project ABC . . .
1. I was reviewing the new information security policy . . .
1. We’re closing the sale on the Jefferson account . . .
1. I’m about to submit a request for time off . . .
1. I read the marketing report you sent me . . .
1. The office supplies have arrived . . .
1. The new budget came out . . .
1. I want to reward my team . . .
1. (list continued)
1. I’m planning the office party . . .
1. We’re reviewing the policy for XYZ . . .
1. My car broke down . . .
1. The kitchen sink is leaking . . .

### ACTIVITY

Look again at the email you chose in the previous chapter. Does it provide clear
context? What would you change to make the context clearer?

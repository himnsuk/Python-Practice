# Write a program which takes as input an array of characters, and removes each 'b' and replaces
# each'a'by two 'd's. Specifically, along with the array, you are provided an integer-valued size. Size
# denotes the number of entries of the array that the operation is to be applied to. You do not have
# to worry about preserving subsequent entries. For example, if the array is (a,b,A,c,-) and the size
# is 4, then you câ‚¬ul retum (d,d,d,d,c). You can assume there is enough space in the array to hold the
# final result.
